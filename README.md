**Characters**:

- **Behrman**: An elderly artist living on the ground floor.
- **Doctor**: Visits Johnsy to check on her condition.

**[Scene 1: Inside the Studio Apartment, Morning]**

**Sue** *(concerned)*: "Johnsy, you haven't touched your food. You need strength to fight this illness."

**Johnsy** *(weakly, gazing out the window)*: "What's the use, Sue? Those leaves... When the last one falls, it'll be my time too."

**Sue**: "Stop this, Johnsy. You're stronger than this! Look at everything we've planned – our next art project, your dream to paint the Bay of Naples."

**Johnsy**: "Dreams don’t matter when there's no time left. I'm bound to these leaves, Sue. With each one that falls, a part of me goes too."

---

**[Scene 2: Outside Johnsy’s Room, Shortly After]**

**Doctor** *(gravely)*: "Her physical condition is only part of the battle, Sue. Her will to live is what's most critical now."

**Sue**: "She's fixated on the vine leaves outside her window. She thinks she'll die when the last leaf falls."

**Doctor**: "Then we must find a way to lift her spirits. Hope can sometimes do what medicine cannot."

**[Scene 3: In Behrman's Studio, Later That Day]**

**Sue** *(desperate)*: "Behrman, we must do something! Johnsy's lost all hope. She says she'll die when the last leaf falls!"

**Behrman** *(irritably)*: "Bah! Superstitious nonsense! How can a young artist give up so easily? She should be fighting, not surrendering!"

**Sue**: "But how can we change what she believes? It's like she's already given up."

**Behrman**: "Hmm... maybe there's something I can do. Leave it to me, Sue."

---

**[Scene 4: Johnsy’s Room, Next Morning]**

**Johnsy** *(in disbelief)*: "Look, Sue! The last leaf! It survived the night, even through the storm!"

**Sue** *(shocked, realizing)*: "That's Behrman's doing! He must have..."

---

**[Scene 5: Doctor’s Visit, Later That Day]**

**Doctor** *(serious)*: "Johnsy's showing signs of improvement. But, there's unfortunate news about Behrman downstairs. He caught pneumonia after a night out in the storm."

---

**[Scene 6: Behrman’s Studio, Revealing the Truth]**

**Sue**: "Johnsy, that leaf... it didn't survive the storm. Behrman painted it. He went out in the cold to give you hope."

**Johnsy** *(tearfully)*: "He did that for me? To help me find the will to live?"

---

**[End Scene: Johnsy's Recovery]**

**Johnsy**: "His masterpiece... it saved me. I'll never give up again. I will paint the Bay of Naples, in his memory."

**Sue**: "And we'll always remember Behrman’s selfless act. His legacy lives on through us."
